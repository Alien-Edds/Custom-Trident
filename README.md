# Custom Trident Template

### How do i use this?
- Copy the scripts, item, and projectile entity. Then modify.

- You can modify the trident stats over at ``scripts/Custom Trident/data.js`` or ``scripts/Custom Trident/data.ts`` if you're compiling the scripts.

### What script files do i get?
- If you aren't gonna compile them, then get the JavaScript files at ``BP/scripts``, if you are gonna compile them, get the TypeScript files at the ``scripts`` folder.
